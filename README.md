## Flatiron Stock Exchange

Welcome to the Flatiron Stock Exchange!
Today, you are a broker who is trying to better organize the stocks available on the Flatiron Stock Market.
The database of stocks can be found in a JSON-server, so before you start your React server, make sure to start your JSON-server on `http://localhost:3000/stocks`.

```
TO INSTALL: npm install -g json-server
TO START: json-server --watch db.json
```

Best of luck!
